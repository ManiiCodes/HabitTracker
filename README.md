# Habit Tracker â€” Advanced

An advanced Habit Tracker built with React (Vite), TailwindCSS and Recharts.
Features include authentication (localStorage), habit CRUD, daily checkmarks, calendar view, progress charts, dark mode, and persistent local storage

## Notes
- Data is saved in localStorage (key: "users").
- To switch to backend later, replace the local DB helper in `src/utils/db.js`.
- Recharts v3 is used and tested with React 19.
